```javascript
// pages/about.js

export default function About() {
  return <p>This is the about page.</p>;
}
```
In the provided example, removing the attempt to use data fetching methods on a page that doesn't actually need them resolves the error.  If data fetching is needed in the `about.js` component, ensure that either `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` is implemented correctly and returns the expected data.
